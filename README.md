## About

[GraphQL-Pokemon][dashboard] is a GraphQL API that provides extensive Pokémon
data. Unlike contemporary APIs this API focusses on speed, accuracy and data
quality. New game data is added within relatively short time after release, and
Smogon tier data is automatically updated after tier shifts. Data used for this
API is pulled from the [Pokemon Showdown GitHub][showdown-github], [Serebii],
and [Bulbapedia].

## Key Features

- Fully generated client-side TypeScript typings published to
  - [npm] as `@favware/graphql-pokemon`
  - [GitHub Package Registry][ghcr_npm] as `@favware/graphql-pokemon`
- Docker images of the API for private hosting published to
  - [Dockerhub] as `favware/graphql-pokemon`
  - [GitHub Package Registry][ghcr_docker] as
    `ghcr.io/favware/graphql-pokemon:latest`
- Provides information about various assets in Pokémon
  - Pokédex
  - Items
  - Abilities
  - Moves
  - Learnsets
  - Type matchups

## JavaScript Companion Library

For those consuming this API through JavaScript, you can install the companion
library to add additional tools for parsing the responses as well as get the
TypeScript typings for the responses.

Install library through your favourite package manager:

```sh
npm install @favware/graphql-pokemon
yarn add @favware/graphql-pokemon
pnpm add @favware/graphql-pokemon
bun add @favware/graphql-pokemon
```

For the usage of the JavaScript Companion Library please see [the autogenerated
documentation][docs].

## API Documentation

There are two ways to consume the documentation that this API offers. They are
as follows.

### Autogenerated text based documentation

For those who want purely text based documentation about all the GraphQL Queries
and Types that are in this API, including a documentation search for those
symbols, please see [the autogenerated documentation][docs] powered by
[magidoc].

### Interactive playground with documentation embedded

For those who want an interactive playground where they can directly test their
queries and read about each query as they select them, please use [the GraphQL
Playground on the API][dashboard].

## Usage

_These examples are written as based on TypeScript. For JavaScript simply change
out the imports to `require` syntax and remove any type information._

### Using `Fetch`

_note: for a working example see [dragonite]_

```ts
import type { Query } from '@favware/graphql-pokemon';

interface GraphQLPokemonResponse<K extends keyof Omit<Query, '__typename'>> {
  data: Record<K, Omit<Query[K], '__typename'>>;
}

fetch('https://graphqlpokemon.favware.tech/v8', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `
      {
        getPokemon(pokemon: dragonite) {
            sprite
            num
            species
            color
        }
      }
    `
  })
})
  .then((res) => res.json() as Promise<GraphQLPokemonResponse<'getPokemon'>>)
  .then((json) => console.log(json.data));
```

### Using `Apollo Boost`

_note: for a working example see [dexa]_

```ts
import type { Query, QueryGetFuzzyPokemonArgs } from '@favware/graphql-pokemon';
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-boost';
import fetch from 'cross-fetch';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

type GraphQLPokemonResponse<K extends keyof Omit<Query, '__typename'>> = Record<
  K,
  Omit<Query[K], '__typename'>
>;

const getFuzzyPokemon = gql`
  query getFuzzyPokemon($pokemon: String!) {
    getFuzzyPokemon(pokemon: $pokemon) {
      sprite
      num
      species
      color
    }
  }
`;

const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://graphqlpokemon.favware.tech/v8',
  fetch
});

const {
  data: { getFuzzyPokemon: pokemonData }
} = await apolloClient.query<
  GraphQLPokemonResponse<'getFuzzyPokemon'>,
  QueryGetFuzzyPokemonArgs
>({
  query: getFuzzyPokemon,
  variables: { pokemon: 'dragonite' }
});

console.log(pokemonData);
```

### Using `Apollo Client React`

```ts
// ApolloClient setup
import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client';
import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';
import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http';

// Instantiate required constructor fields
const cache = new InMemoryCache();
const link = new HttpLink({
  uri: 'https://graphqlpokemon.favware.tech/v8'
});

export const client = new ApolloClient({
  // Provide required constructor fields
  cache: cache,
  link: link,

  // Provide some optional constructor fields
  name: 'graphql-pokemon-client',
  version: '1.0',
  queryDeduplication: false,
  defaultOptions: {
    watchQuery: {
      fetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network'
    }
  }
});
```

```tsx
// Component
import React from 'react';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/react-hooks';
import type { Query } from '@favware/graphql-pokemon';
import { client } from './ApolloClient';

interface GraphQLPokemonResponse<K extends keyof Omit<Query, '__typename'>> {
  data: Record<K, Omit<Query[K], '__typename'>>;
}

const GET_POKEMON_DETAILS = gql`
  {
    getPokemon(pokemon: dragonite) {
      sprite
      num
      species
      color
    }
  }
`;

export const Pokemon: React.FC = () => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery<
    GraphQLPokemonResponse<'getPokemon'>
  >(GET_POKEMON_DETAILS, {
    client: client
  });

  if (loading) return 'Loading...';
  if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

  return <div> Insert how you want to display the data here </div>;
};
```
