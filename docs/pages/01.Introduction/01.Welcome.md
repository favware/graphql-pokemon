# Welcome

Welcome to the `graphql-pokemon` project!

This projects contains a GraphQL API for retrieving information about Pokémon.
The API allows users to query for information about Pokémon, including their
types, abilities, and moves. The data for the Pokémon is sourced from the
popular video game series, provided by external sources such as
[Smogon](https://www.smogon.com), [Serebii](https://serebii.net), and
[Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net).

The easiest way to get to know this API is to try it out in the
[playground](https://graphqlpokemon.favware.tech/v8).

For implementing the API in your own code, choose your preferred language and
method of making Web requests. Beyond that point you will need to learn the
GraphQL syntax, and the documentation on this website as well as the queries
provided by the [playground](https://graphqlpokemon.favware.tech/v8) will help
you get started.
